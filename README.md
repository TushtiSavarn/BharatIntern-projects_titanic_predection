# Description:

The Titanic Prediction Project is a data science project aimed at predicting the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of Titanic passengers, such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and cabin information, to develop predictive models.


# Dataset:
The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with the training set used to train machine learning models and the test set used to evaluate their performance.

#Approach:

The project follows the typical data science workflow, including:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between features and survival outcomes.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Trying out various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning model parameters to optimize performance.
Prediction: Making predictions on the test set and assessing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
